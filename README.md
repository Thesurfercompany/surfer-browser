ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English â€“ How the community can help

While The Surfer Company leads the project, we believe in open collaboration. We invite developers, designers, and creators to explore, experiment, and help build something unique.

ðŸ”§ Ways to contribute:

Fork the repo, modify the code, and suggest new features.

Share mockups, screenshots, or sketches of your UI ideas.

Report bugs or suggest user experience improvements.

Improve visual design or browser structure.

Help with documentation, translations, or performance.

ðŸŽ¨ Got a visual idea? Awesome! You can attach an image, Figma link, or screenshot in an issue or pull request. You can also record a quick video prototype if you like.

We carefully review all contributions. Letâ€™s build a browser shaped by creativity and community input
